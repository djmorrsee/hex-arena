# RPG/Moba Elements

This document serves to outline the rpg/moba elements found within HexArena.

## RPG Elements

I want to create an rpg system similar to that found in P&D. Each monster has attack, defense, health values, etc. and can be powered up over time.

## Moba Elements

I want there to be some kind of creep mechanic like those found in typical mobas. Some other kind of objective than just killing the other players. This will prevent games full of kiting etc.

Typical moba elements:

> A per game xp system (gain levels, gold, etc. then restart the next game)
> Lanes/Waves of computer controlled 'creeps' that can be killed for xp and gold
> Towers/Objectives that can be destroyed for xp/gold
> A 'Jungle' or sets of neutral creeps that can be killed


## Progression

The problem I'm trying to solve is where do we want to land with progression? Moba's start you over at 0 every game, and rpg's you grind till your high level and own everything. What do we want? I like the idea of levelling up a la Puzzles and Dragons, but I don't know how to make it work the moba idear.
